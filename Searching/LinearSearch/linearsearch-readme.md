# Linear Search

- Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

## How It Works ?

## Time Complexity

> In the worst case scenario we have to look at every item in the array. That means it would run in O(n) complexity.

## Space Complexity

> Space Complexity: O(1)
