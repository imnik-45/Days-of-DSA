# Binary Search

- Binary search is the most popular Search algorithm.It is efficient and also one of the most commonly used techniques that is used to solve problems.

- Binary search works only on a sorted set of elements. To use binary search on a collection, the collection must first be sorted.

- When binary search is used to perform operations on a sorted set, the number of iterations can always be reduced on the basis of the value that is being searched.

## Time Complexity

> As we dispose off one part of the search case during every step of binary search, and perform the search operation on the other half, this results in a worst case time complexity of .

## Space Complexity

> Space Complexity of Binary Search is - O(1).
